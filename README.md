# CI/CD Deployment to AWS EC2 Using GitHub Actions & Docker

## Introduction
In this guide, we'll walk through a simple but production‑grade CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys a Dockerized application to an AWS EC2 instance using GitHub Actions, Docker Hub, and SSH remote execution.

Each time you push to the **main** branch, GitHub Actions:

- Builds a Docker image of your app  
- Pushes that image to Docker Hub  
- SSHes into your EC2 server  
- Stops the running container  
- Removes the stopped container  
- Pulls the new image  
- Starts a fresh container with the latest image version  

---

## ⚠️ Before You Begin — Important Prerequisite ⚠️

For this pipeline to work, you must already have an EC2 server running with the following:

- Install Docker  
- Start the Docker service  
- Modify Docker socket permission  
- Ensure the security group allows SSH access (restrict inbound SSH to your IP only)  
- Ensure inbound port **80** is allowed (if your app listens on port 80)  

---

## 🐳 Your Dockerfile (The Heart of the Deployment)

Before anything can be deployed, your app needs to be packaged into a Docker image.  
Here is the Dockerfile used in the repository:


## Secure the Website on AWS EC2 Using Nginx and Let's Encrypt (Certbot)
### Step 1: Install and Start Nginx
Nginx will act as your reverse proxy and HTTPS termination layer.
- sudo dnf install -y nginxsudo systemctl enable --now nginxShow more lines

### Step 2: Install Certbot (Let's Encrypt Client)
Install Certbot with Nginx support:
- sudo dnf install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx

### Step 3: Configure Nginx as a Reverse Proxy
Create a config file for your domain:
- sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.conf

Add:
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name nnamdidevops.uk www.nnamdidevops.uk;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}

Test and reload:
- sudo nginx -tsudo systemctl reload nginx
Your site should now load over HTTP.

### Step 4: Request Your SSL Certificate
sudo certbot --nginx -d nnamdidevops.uk -d www.nnamdidevops.uk

### Step 5: Verify HTTPS
Your site is now HTTPS-secured.
Verify in your browser:
https://nnamdidevops.uk

## Understanding What the Pipeline Does

- Triggered by pushing to main
- Logs into Docker Hub
- Builds and pushes the Docker image
- SSHes into your EC2 instance
- Stops, removes, pulls, and runs the new container
